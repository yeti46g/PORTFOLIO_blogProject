### 1. About

This project is part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree for students to start building a data science portfolio. The project includes a blog post (posted on Medium in my case) and a github repo. The steps required are :
	(1) Pick a dataset.
	(2) Pose at least three questions relatec to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.
	(3) Create a jupyter notebook to prepare, analyze, model, and visualize data.

	(4) Communicate your business insights by creating a github repo to share code and data with a technical audience, and by creating a blog post to share insights with a non-technical audience.


Here, I picked a [competition dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) about house price in Ames, Iowa between 2006-2010. Based on the scope of the dataset, I asked and answered the following three questions: 

	(1) How expensive is this town to live in?
	(2) Which are the popular neighborhoods?
	(3) How much should I budget for if I were to buy a house in Ames that fits my preferences during that time period?

Please see the jupyter notebook in this repo for my analyses and data visualizations. Here is also my blog on Medium.
